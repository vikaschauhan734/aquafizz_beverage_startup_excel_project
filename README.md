## Business Task
To maintain high productivity levels, AquaFizz needs to ensure that all employees adhere to their working hours. This case study will involve analyzing working hours data to identify patterns and ensure compliance with company policies. The goal is to foster a work culture where productivity and fairness are prioritized.

## Data Used
The data source for this case study is an employee working hours log provided in an Excel file. The dataset includes details such as the date, hours worked, and minutes worked for each employee.

## Business Scenario
AquaFizz management has noticed discrepancies in the working hours logged by employees. They want to ensure that all employees work their full allotted hours to maintain productivity and fairness. The following tasks need to be completed using the provided Excel file: Workers Timing

1. **Convert Working Time to Decimal:** The standard working time of 8 hours and 30 minutes needs to be converted into a decimal format. This conversion will be used as a benchmark for compliance.

2. **Calculate Actual Working Hours:** For each entry, calculate the total hours worked by converting minutes into a fraction of an hour. This will help in determining the exact working hours logged by each employee.

3. **Determine Compliance:** Compare the actual working hours with the agreed working time of 8 hours and 30 minutes. Allow a tolerance of up to minus six minutes. Label entries as "Compliant" or "Non-compliant" based on this comparison.

4. **Calculate Hours Worked:** Extract the full hours worked from the total working hours. This provides a clearer view of the time logged without fractions.

5. **Calculate Minutes Worked:** Calculate the equivalent minute value for the fractional part of the hours worked. This ensures a precise understanding of the time logged.

6. **Compute Deviation in Minutes:** For non-compliant entries, calculate the deviation in minutes relative to the agreed working time. Compliant entries should show a deviation of 0.

7. **Non-Compliance Message:** Generate a message for non-compliant cases indicating the date, hours, minutes worked, and the deviation from the contracted time. This message should be formatted to inform the employee of the discrepancy and request them to look into it.

8. **Formatting and Organization:** Apply suitable formatting to the worksheet to enhance readability and ensure data is well-organized. This includes bold headers, borders for cells, and conditional formatting to highlight non-compliant entries.
